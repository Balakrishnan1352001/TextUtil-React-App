# TextUtil-React-App

TextUtil is a sophisticated web application built using React.js that provides a variety of text manipulation functions. The software is intended to make it simple for users to execute text operations such as converting between uppercase and lowercase, clearing text, copying text, and displaying relevant information such as word count, line count, and character count. Let's take a closer look at the many functionalities:

1. Uppercase to Lowercase Conversion:- The utility allows users to convert all text to lowercase, which is handy when you want to define the case of your content or make it more readable.
2. Lowercase to Uppercase Conversion:- Similarly, the utility allows users to change all text to uppercase, which is useful when you need to emphasise or format certain information.
3. Clear Text:- This function allows users to delete all text from the input field, creating a blank slate for adding new material or beginning a new text manipulation activity.
4. Text Copy:- Users may effortlessly copy the altered text to their clipboard with this capability, allowing for quick and straightforward sharing or pasting elsewhere.
5. Word Count:- The word count functionality in TextUtil calculates the total number of words in the entered text. This is useful for authors, students, or anybody who needs to keep track of the number of words in their work.
6. Line Count:- The software also has a line count function that counts the number of lines in the entered text. This might be useful for formatting or analysing the text's structure.
7. Character Count:- The character count functionality in TextUtil estimates the total number of characters in the entered text. Spaces, punctuation marks, and special characters are all included. Character count is frequently useful in content production or while sticking to character constraints.
